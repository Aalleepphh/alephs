<body>
    <p>Emperor Pele I of Brazil recently began a campaign to conquer the entire world. The conquest was short and decisive with all the countries of the world currently under his rule. The last country to surrender was the United States with former president Joe Biden saying: "The United States is clearly a weaker enemy in the eyes of the Brazilian empire. We are no match and must therefore immediately allow ourselves to be annexed."</p>
